Day 3 - Python Challenge: Variables, Data Types & Input

Today I continued my Python journey by learning about variables, data types, and the input() function.

ðŸ”¹ Variables: I learned how to create variables to store data like numbers, text, or boolean values. I understood that variable names should be meaningful and can't start with a number.

ðŸ”¹ Data Types: I explored the main data types in Python:

int for integers (e.g., 5)

float for decimals (e.g., 3.14)

str for strings (e.g., "Hello")

bool for boolean values (True or False)

I practiced using the type() function to check the data type of a variable.

ðŸ”¹ Input Function: I learned how to take user input using input() and how all inputs are treated as strings by default. I also learned how to convert inputs to int or float when needed using int() and float().
